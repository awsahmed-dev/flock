 * Which city a destination string means.

 * Written for the backfill that gave every pre-existing trip a shape — 42
 * of them, created before any of this existed, whose owners opened the app
 * after the release and correctly saw nothing new. A trip with no
 * `trip_segments` row has no shape, no city screen and no gateways, so the
 * whole rebuild was invisible to everyone who already had a trip.
 *
 * Destinations in the wild are messy: "Tokyo, Japan", "ماليزيا", "Tbilisi
 * International Airport, تبلّيسي، جورجيا", "Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia",
 * and — genuinely — "Potato". The order below is the part that matters.
